In this project, I analysed the US Accidents Dataset(1.5 million accidents), which had information about 1.5 million accidents listed in US.
The dataset has 1.5 million rows and 47 columns.
Through the analysis, I aim to :
1. Get to know the ‘car accident prediction’ better
2. Provide a detailed analysis for studying car accidents hotspot locations(cities and state's which have max accidents).
3. To understand the impact of weather on car accidents.
4. To studying the timing where accidents is more hourly basis,daily basis and monthly basis.
5. To answer some of the common questions that can help to prevent it.

Steps Followed :
Step 1: Selecting a real-world dataset
Step 2: Performing data preparation & cleaning
Step 3: Performing exploratory analysis & visualization and asking interesting questions
